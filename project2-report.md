CISSP Domains Overview

Summarize key points of each CISSP domain relevant to risk management:

1. **Security and Risk Management**: risk mitigation, set security goals, following rules and protecting organization and adhering to laws and legal standards
2. **Asset Security**: knowing what assets you own and how to store, access and dispose them. Creating backup for data in case of security breach
3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**: deals with tools and technologies used to protect data. Principles like least privileges and defence in depth
4. **Communication and Network Security**: protect data in transit, secure both wired and wireless connection

4.) Awareness campaigns- posters, newsletters and awareness videos to spread the key messages

5.) TCS might leverage its own platform TCS iON to deliver these programs

* **Schedule**:

1.) Regular training sessions which are conducted in every 3 or 6 months for evolving threats

2.) Special initiatives during cybersecurity awareness month (in October)

**Step 5: Monitoring and Review**

Continuous Monitoring

* **Monitoring Processes**:

1.) Continuous tracking- TCS employs real time monitoring of cybersecurity measures and risk activities. This includes tracking compliance with policies, identifying vulnerabilities and test effectiveness of implemented controls

2.) Incident reporting- A structured process is in place for reporting and addressing security incidents promptly

3.) Feedback mechanisms- regular feedbacks is collected from stakeholders to identify areas of improvement

* **Tools/Technologies Used**:

1.) SIEM (security information and event management) systems- tools like Splunk are used for real time monitoring and analysis of security alerts

2.) Risk management platforms- custom built or third party platforms are used to manage and track risks

3.) Awareness tools- platforms like TCS Ion are leveraged for delivering training and tracking employee participation in the program

Periodic Review

* **Review Frequency**:

1.) Annual reviews- policies and frameworks are reviewed annually or whenever there are major changes in operating environment

2.) Quarterly audits- internal audits are conducted regularly to ensure compliance with security policies and procedures

* **Review Criteria**:

1.) Effectiveness of controls- assess whether implemented controls are mitigating risks as planned

2.) Incident response- evaluate the efficiency and timeline of incident response processes

3.) Employee awareness- measure the overall effectiveness of training program through assessments

Some main challenges I encountered while doing this project

1. Difficulty in developing strategy for certain risks as they were overlapping
2. Even more difficulty in implementation of framework in whole company ecosystem as well defining proper steps and timeline

* **Learnings**:

1. 8 CISSP domains which are related to risk management
2. Different types of potential threats as well as vulnerabilities for company’s assets
3. Different types of risks for each of these assets
4. Mitigation strategies for each of these risks and which of these risks are related to which CISSP domain

* **Next Steps for Further Improvement**:

Keep myself aware and up to date about evolving threats as well as security trends in the tech market and in future develop policies accordingly for these threats
